# fspec.videos Project Foundation

## Vision

Create automated, consistent, and reproducible demo videos of fspec's Terminal User Interface, enabling scalable documentation and onboarding through scripted terminal recordings.

---

## Problem Space

### Manual terminal demo recording is time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to maintain

When creating documentation and tutorials for fspec, developers need to produce demo videos showing the TUI in action. Manual recording requires screen capture software, careful typing to avoid mistakes, and multiple takes to achieve professional results. Each time fspec's UI changes or new features are added, all affected videos must be re-recorded from scratch. This creates a maintenance burden that makes it impractical to maintain a comprehensive library of up-to-date demo videos. The result is either outdated documentation or significant time investment in manual video production.

**Impact:** high

## Solution Space

### Overview

Automated demo video generation through scriptable terminal interactions, allowing developers to define demo scenarios as code that can be executed and recorded on demand. Demo scripts are version-controlled alongside the codebase, ensuring videos stay synchronized with features and can be regenerated instantly whenever the UI changes.

### Capabilities

- **Record Terminal Demo Videos**: Execute demo scripts and capture the terminal interactions as video files with configurable size, FPS, and format
- **Write Scriptable Demo Scenarios**: Define terminal interaction scenarios as version-controlled TypeScript scripts using the tui-test framework
- **List Available Demo Scripts**: View all available demo scripts in the project
